    "description": "Paris is like nowhere else when it comes to love. This is a city that encourages all in it to be free, light of spirit and carefree. Venice, Rome and New York all lay claim to being romantic, but Paris has its own special aura, because the City of Light is also the City of Love. Whether it's lounging on the grass outside The Museum of Romantic Life, purring sweet nothings under the Eiffel Tower or embracing in front of 'The Wall of I Love You', Paris is the ultimate place of the heart.",
